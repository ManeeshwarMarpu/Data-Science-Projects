This project demonstrates a comprehensive workflow for forecasting temperature using time series data and ARIMA modeling. The main objectives of the project are to:

    Preprocess and Clean Data:
    Prepare historical weather data by handling missing values and extracting the temperature series for analysis.

    Model Building and Forecasting:
    Fit an ARIMA(5, 1, 0) model to the cleaned temperature data and forecast future values. The project generates a 30-step forecast and visualizes the predicted temperature against historical observations.

    Residual and Diagnostic Analysis:
    Perform residual analysis by plotting residuals, histograms, and autocorrelation (ACF/PACF) charts to ensure that the model errors are random (white noise). This step validates that the model effectively captures the underlying time series patterns.

    Seasonal Decomposition:
    Use seasonal decomposition to uncover the trend and seasonal components within the temperature data, providing additional insights into the data's structure.

    Rolling Forecast Backtesting:
    Implement a rolling forecast (or backtesting) approach to evaluate model performance over a test set. Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are calculated to quantify forecasting accuracy.

This project integrates data preprocessing, ARIMA model fitting, comprehensive diagnostic checks, and forecast evaluation to deliver a robust time series analysis framework. It serves as a practical example for anyone interested in learning time series forecasting, weather analysis, and model validation techniques.
