Project Description

This project focuses on predicting diabetes using machine learning techniques. We use a medical dataset containing patient health indicators to develop models that can classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic. The primary objective is to analyze the data, preprocess it, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

Steps Completed in This Project:
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing

    We used a dataset containing medical records of patients with various health indicators.
    Checked for missing values and handled them accordingly.
    Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.
    Standardized the dataset using StandardScaler to ensure uniformity across different feature ranges.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Visualized the dataset using histograms and correlation heatmaps to understand feature importance.
    Analyzed the relationships between different variables and their impact on diabetes prediction.

3. Model Selection and Training

    Implemented Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier as initial models.
    Split the dataset into training and testing sets to validate model performance.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning

    Used GridSearchCV to optimize the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model for better performance.
    Identified the best combination of parameters for improved accuracy.

5. Model Evaluation

    Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    Generated confusion matrices to visualize model performance in distinguishing diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
    Plotted ROC curves to compare the predictive power of different models.

6. Feature Importance Analysis

    Analyzed which features contributed most to the predictions using the Random Forest feature importance method.

Key Findings & Insights

    Random Forest performed better after hyperparameter tuning, achieving improved classification performance.
    Certain features, such as glucose level and BMI, had a significant impact on diabetes prediction.
    The ROC curve analysis helped visualize how well the models distinguished between diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Future Scope

    Implement additional machine learning models like SVM, Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost for further improvements.
    Integrate deep learning techniques for enhanced prediction accuracy.
    Deploy the model as a web-based or mobile application for real-world usability.
